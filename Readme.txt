'Final Project Prompt'

Goals
Apply all the fundamental knowledge gathered across the semester( HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery, PHP, databases and security) to the design, implementation, and presentation of a final project.

Instructions
- Ideally, your final project will be an extension and transformation of the website you developed for your midterm project.
- You will code your website and upload it to a free web hosting service such as www.000webhost.com, www.awardspace.com, or webfreehosting.net. If you want to use a different web hosting service, make sure it allows you to use databases and PHP. If you choose to buy a web hosting service such as  www.hostinger.com, www.a2hosting.com, you can also do that (some places allow you to pay monthly).
- Design and test your database on the web hosting of your choice. 
- Make sure to perform extensive testing of your website, so you can find and fix as many bugs as possible before the presentation date.
- Your project should implement a responsive design in which your website adapts to the different output media (smartphone, tablets, laptops, desktops, and so on).
- Keep it simple and do not overwhelm yourselves, make sure the basics are covered before starting miscellaneous features.

Technologies and Concepts
Each team will make use of the technologies explained in class, as well as Internet resources and the course book to complete the final project. Such technologies are:
- HTML5
- CSS and Bootstrap
- JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX
- PHP
- MySQL Database.
